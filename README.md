# Squat 114mm f/3.95 Astrograph Telescope

This is a 114mm f/3.95 450mm FL fully enclosed, 3d-printable astrograph.

## Printing notes

While printing there are a couple of spots where you need to use captured nuts. For each spider, you'll want to use your slicer to pause the print when the hexagons are fully open on their last layer. For the primary mirror collimation nut, you'll want to do the same.

Print 3 collimation nuts (primary & secondary).
Print 2 of each clamp file.

## Parts list

- 114mm 450mm FL parabolic mirror
- 30mm elliptical mirror
- GSO 2" focuser - [this is the one that the top OTA is designed around](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800070171786.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.4da42e409aEJt0&algo_pvid=46c0579a-22f9-4327-82b6-e3bee86ad9e6&algo_exp_id=46c0579a-22f9-4327-82b6-e3bee86ad9e6-1&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%21121.50%21114.21%21%21%21882.36%21829.42%21%402103273e17349743977983875e72d9%2112000040407453639%21sea%21US%21782326845%21X&curPageLogUid=u32gm9S0JlY5&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
- Vixen plate - [this is the one that I used](https://amzn.to/4gNzF38)
- Silicone glue (used for attaching mirrors)
- M4 nuts - 12 (4 for the clamps, 3 for the primary collimation nuts, 1 for the secondary mirror cell, 4 for the spider)
- M3 heatset inserts - 4 (used for attaching for the focuser to the top OTA)
- M3 screws 10-12 - 4
- M6 heatsets inserts - 12 (used for the clamps)
- M4 heatset inserts - 3 (primary mirror cell)
- M4x50 screws - 7 (4 for secondary mirror cell, 3 for primary mirror cell
- M3 screws - 4
- 8mm OD 20-30mm Free Length springs - 4

## Assembly

After printing all pieces, you're ready for assembly.

1. Put a M4x50 screw through the secondary mirror cell, tighten it in using a nut on the top
2. Use silicone glue to attach the 30mm eliptical mirror to the secondary mirror cell - let it rest for 24 hours
3. Insert 3 M4 heatset inserts into the primary mirror cell
4. Use silicone glue to attach the primary mirror to the primary mirror cell - let it rest for 24 hours
5. One silicone glue is dry, attach the secondary mirror cell to the spider, tightening with a nut at the top of the spider. Make sure that you use a spring between the secondary mirror cell and the spider. It should go around the screw
6. Install 4 M3 heatsets into the top OTA where the focuser will go
7. Install the primary mirror and mirror cell into the bottom OTA. Put the primary mirror collimation nuts onto some M4x50 screws, make sure they are all the way at the head of the screw. Put the screws through the 3 holes on the bottom side of the OTA, put springs around the screws and then while carefully placing the mirror into the OTA, screw the M4x50 screws into the primary mirror cell
8. Put the spider into the top OTA, it should be a friction fit but if your printer's tolerance levels are different, screw holes exist in both the spider and the top OTA
9. Combine the top and bottom OTAs using the twist lock system on each assembly
10. Insert M6 heatsets into each side of each clamp
11. Tighten down the clamps around the OTA, one clamp should be around the top OTA and one clamp should be around the bottom OTA
12. Attach a vixen plate to the clamps to keep everything nice and tight
13. Collimate
